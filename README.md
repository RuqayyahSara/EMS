# EMS
An Exam Management System for our cohort at CS.CODE.IN that allows the instructor to enter marks in Sheets, and sends calculated grades to the fellows using a Command Line Utility. It has three three user roles; admin, instructor and fellow.
Sheets API has been used to fetch and enter marks in the sheet.
